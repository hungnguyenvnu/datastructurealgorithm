# Graph

* A graph is a way of representing relationships that exist between pairs of objects.
    - A graph is a set of objects, called vertices, together with a collection of pairwise connections between them. 
    
    - Graphs have applications in a host of different domains, including mapping, transportation, electrical engineering, and computer networks.

* A graph G is simply a set V of vertices and a collection E of pairs of vertices from V , called edges.

    * A graph is a way of representing connections or relationships between pairs of objects from some set V.
    
    * "vertices" and “edges.” Edges in a graph are either directed or undirected. 
        * An edge (u, v) is said to be **directed** from u to v if the pair (u, v) is ordered, with u preceding v. 
        * An edge (u, v) is said to be **undirected** if the pair (u, v) is not ordered. (u, v), noting that in the undirected case (u, v) is the same as (v , u). 
        * Example:
            * Visualize collaborations among the researchers of a certain discipline by constructing a graph

 * If all the edges in a graph are undirected, then we say the graph is an undirected graph. A directed graph, also called a digraph, is a graph whose edges are all directed
