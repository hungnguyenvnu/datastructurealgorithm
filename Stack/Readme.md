# Stack

* A **stack** is a container of objects that are inserted and removed according to the **last-in first-out (LIFO)** principle

* Application

  - Internet Web browsers store the addresses of recently visited sites on a stack. 
    - Each time a user visits a new site, that site’s address is “pushed” onto the stack of addresses. 
    - The browser then allows the user to “pop” back to previously visited sites using the “back” button.


  - Text editors usually provide an “undo” mechanism that cancels recent editing operations and reverts to former states of a document. 
    - This undo operation can be accomplished by keeping text changes in a stack.
